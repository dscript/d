// It may be a partial interest in the property or it may be the full. 
// However, because you have title, you can access the land and potentially modify it as you see fit. Title also means that you can transfer that interest or portion that you own to others. 
// However, you can never legally transfer more than you own.

// Deeds, on the other hand, are actually the legal documents that transfer title from one person to another.
