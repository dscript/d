// Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures

// The CUSIP number is a unique identification number assigned to all stocks and registered bonds in the United States and Canada,
// and it is used to create a concrete distinction between securities that are traded on public markets.
// Foreign securities have a similar number called the CINS number.


// The CUSIP number consists of a combination of nine characters, including letters and numbers, which act as a sort of DNA for the security, 
// uniquely identifying the company or issuer and the type of security. The following explains what each character represents:

// - The first six characters identify the issuer and are assigned alphabetically.
// - The seventh and eighth characters—which can be alphabetical or numerical—identify the type of security.
// - The ninth and last digit is used as a check digit.
