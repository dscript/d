UPIC identifier (code: "upic") : UID { } 


// A UPIC acts exactly like a US bank account number and protects sensitive banking information. 
// The actual bank account number, including the bank's ABA routing transit number, are masked by the UPIC. 
// Only credit transactions to an account can be initiated with a UPIC. 
// All direct debits are blocked, which should mitigate unauthorized transactions to an account.

// UPICs point to a single bank account. However, one account can have several UPICs
