// Board directors may make motions before a board meeting and ask the board chair to include them in the agenda for a board of directorsâ€™ meeting.

// The board chair must handle all motions in some matter. Boards can second and vote on a motion or move to amend a motion.

//There are four basic steps in making motions. A board director makes a motion and then someone seconds it. The board chair calls for discussion, and then the board votes.
