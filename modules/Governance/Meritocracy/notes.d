// Meritocracy (merit, from Latin mereō, and -cracy, from Ancient Greek κράτος kratos 'strength, power')
//  is a political system in which economic goods and/or political power are vested in individual people
//  on the basis of talent, effort, and achievement, rather than wealth or social class.
// [1] Advancement in such a system is based on performance, as measured through examination or demonstrated achievement. 
// Although the concept of meritocracy has existed for centuries, the term itself was coined in 1958 by the sociologist
//  Michael Dunlop Young in his satirical essay The Rise of the Meritocracy.


// Supporters of meritocracy do not necessarily agree on the nature of "merit"; however, they do tend to agree that "merit" itself should be a primary consideration during evaluation.

// Ability is under Agency


// and is sometimes used to refer to any government run by "a ruling or influential class of educated or able people"



//  Education alone, however, does not constitute a complete system, as meritocracy must automatically confer power and authority, which a degree does not accomplish independently.


// The reliability of the authority and system that assesses each individual's merit is another point of concern.
// As a meritocratic system relies on a standard of merit to measure and compare people against, the system by 
// which this is done has to be reliable to ensure that their assessed merit accurately reflects their potential capabilities.
// Standardized testing, which reflects the meritocratic sorting process, has come under criticism for being rigid and 
// unable to accurately assess many valuable qualities and potentials of students. Education theorist Bill Ayers, 
// commenting on the limitations of standardized testing, writes that "Standardized tests can't measure initiative,
// creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, 
// ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count 
// are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant
// aspects of learning."[48] Merit determined through the opinionated evaluations of teachers, while being able to 
// assess the valuable qualities that cannot be assessed by standardized testing, are unreliable as the opinions, insights, 
// biases, and standards of the teachers vary greatly. If the system of evaluation is corrupt, non-transparent, 
// opinionated or misguided, decisions regarding who has the highest merit can be highly fallible.
