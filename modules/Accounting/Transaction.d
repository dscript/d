Transaction record : Base::Transaction {

}


// An accounting transaction modifies one or more accounting records.

// A transaction typically debits an amount from one account and credits it to another account

// Transaction in an accounting journal that shows a company's debit and credit balances. 
// The journal entry can consist of several recordings, each of which is either a debit or a credit.
// The total of the debits must equal the total of the credits, or the journal entry is considered unbalanced.


// Journal entries can record unique items or recurring items such as depreciation or bond amortization. 
// In accounting software, journal entries are usually entered using a separate module from accounts payable,
// which typically has its own subledger, that indirectly affects the general ledger. 
// As a result, journal entries directly change the account balances on the general ledger. 
// A properly documented journal entry consists of the correct date, amount(s) that will be debited, amount that will be credited, description of transaction, and unique reference number (i.e. check number).[1]
