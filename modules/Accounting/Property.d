// Intellectual property (IP) refers to a legal entitlement which sometimes 
// attaches to the expressed form of an idea, or to some other intangible subject matter. 

// Thus the law broadly distinguishes between real property (land and anything affixed to it) and personal property (everything else, e.g., clothing, furniture, money). 

// Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways, such as goods, money, negotiable instruments, securities, and intangible assets including choses in action.
// This legal entitlement generally enables its holder to exercise exclusive rights of use in relation to the subject matter of the IP. 
// The term intellectual property reflects the idea that this subject matter is the product of the mind or the intellect, and that IP rights may be protected at law in the same way as any other form of property.
