Property::Intellectual concept {


}


// Intellectual property (IP) refers to a legal entitlement which sometimes 
// attaches to the expressed form of an idea, or to some other intangible subject matter. 


// This legal entitlement generally enables its holder to exercise exclusive rights of use in relation to the subject matter of the IP. 
// The term intellectual property reflects the idea that this subject matter is the product of the mind or the intellect, and that IP rights may be protected at law in the same way as any other form of property.
