Settlement process { 


}



// Settlement is the actual exchange of money and securities between the parties of a trade
// on the settlement date after agreeing earlier on the trade. 
// Most settlement of securities trading nowadays is done electronically.
// Stock trades are settled in 3 business days (T+3), while government bonds and options are
// settled the next business day (T+1). Forex transactions where the currencies are from 
// North American countries have T+1 settlement date, while trades involving currencies outside 
// of North America have a T+2 settlement date. 
// In futures, settlement refers to the mark-to-market of accounts using the final closing price for the day. 
// A futures settlement may result in a margin call if there are insufficient funds to cover the new closing price.
