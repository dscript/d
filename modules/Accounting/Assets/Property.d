  ownerships: [] Ownership
}

// May be Real, Personal, or Intellectual

// Ownership of property may change

// Ownership is a cerification record by a trusted authority

// Thus the law broadly distinguishes between real property (land and anything affixed to it) and personal property (everything else, e.g., clothing, furniture, money).
