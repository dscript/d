# DSharp.

NOTE: This is all experimental. Do not expect this to work!

Update: May 1st, 2017: Currently waiting on Utf8String to graduate corefx lab.

Aspiring strongly typed language inspired by C#, Swift, JavaScript and Rust -- with first class support for targeting both JavaScript and the Core CRL. The initial implementation is being bootstrapped with C#.

High Level Features
* Immutable by default
* UTF8 everywhere
* Pattern Matching
* User defined units & operators w/ automatic conversions
* Protocals
* Used defined operators & extensions
 
Breve syntax with strong inferance.

* Parenthesis are omited in most cases
* Semicolons are only needed to deliminate statements on the same line

Status

* Initial Parser 
* Initial Shape of Syntax & Expression Trees
* Stubs for compilation, type inference, etc

NEED HELP

* Finalizing syntax
* Developing CoreCRL & JavaScript transpilers
* Finalizing ML based type system & autocompletion
* Testing
* Developing base Library shape and aquisition methods
