# Functions

Functions defined within implementations are known as Methods.

In addition to the function keyword, the unicode literal ƒ may also be used.

## Literals

Return type is optional if the type can be infered from the body.

```
name function() -> Type { 
   // body
}

name ƒ() {
  return 1;
}


```
